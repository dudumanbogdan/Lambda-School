# Lambda-School

This is a conglomerate folder containing each project I have worked on during my time at Lambda School. Each repository is nested as a submodule. 

**Please Note:** Submodules will link you to the most recent commit - *not* the master branch. If you would like to see the most relevant, and up-to-date version, please ensure to checkout the 'dylan-mestyanek' branch on any repository you are viewing. Thanks! :D

**Structure:** Each week consists of a project we worked on each day of the week, in addition to a weekly *"Sprint Challenge"* held on Friday mornings. Every 4 week span consists of *"Build Week"* or *"Project Week"*. These projects were built as a team with a group of other Lambda Students.
