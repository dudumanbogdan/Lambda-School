                    <h3> Living A Healthy Life </h3>
                    <p> Our number one goal with <em>Insuline</em> application is to keep your nutrition, and glucose levels, in order. We take the "guessing" out of the equation. It's been proven that steady glucose levels result in longer lasting energy, greater focus, and a healthier system overall. Our mission with the <em>Insuline</em> is to give you the power to input, and monitor, your glucose levels during all hours of the day. In doing so, we can predict your future glucose levels, so you can catch any trending low, or high, glucose levels.</p>

                    <p> The process is short, and broken down into 3 simple steps: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Consistently input your glucose measurements, and the time of day the input has taken place. </li>
                        <li> Input insulin dose and type.  </li>
                        <li> <em>That's it!</em> Simply log your glucose measurements, and insulin intake, and the app will take care of the rest. That way you can spend <em>less</em> time doing calculations, and <em>more</em> time enjoying your day... and food! </li>
